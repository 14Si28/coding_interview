Problem statements quoted from:
Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X

The book contains explanations for each solution and general advice on technical interviews.

Notes
===============

I've deviated from some of the solutions presented in the book, usually for simplicity.
For solutions that in Python are one liners, such as reversing a string,
I've written verbose (and unpythonic) code to illustrate actual solutions.
I've ignored PEP-8 for some imports to avoid PYTHONPATH issues when running from the directory the files reside in.

Tests
===============

Each solution is (largly) self contained with tests run for main. You can run all tests via::
    nosetests
