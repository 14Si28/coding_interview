Problem statements quoted from:
Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

The book contains explanations for each solution and general advice on technical interviews.

I've deviated from some of the solutions presented in the book, usually for simplicity.
For solutions that in Python are one liners, such as reversing a string,
I've written verbose (and unpythonic) code to illustrate actual solutions.
