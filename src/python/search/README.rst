"Search. In New York City alone Airbnb has 3,600 diverse properties--- more choices than any other accommodation site. How do we compute relevance when the factors are at a minimum a combination of availability, location, price, reputation, type of space, etc? How do we sort by price when it is a function of dates and a multitude of business rules? How do you make the comparison process manageable to the user?" http://nerds.airbnb.com/hard-problems-big-opportunity
