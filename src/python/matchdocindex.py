"""
Given a data structure that maps words to document indexes, return a list of document indexes that match all terms.

e.g.

Given:
{ 
    yummy: [0, 3, 7, 8]
    japanese: [3, 5, 8]
    ramen: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
}

Return:
[3, 8]

This problem is a simplified presentation of word level inverted indexes.
